In my paper, "Understanding Technology," I examine the relationship between humans and technology through the lenses of Plato, Heidegger, and contemporary AI discourse and their connections.
From Plato's skepticism towards writing to Heidegger's concern about technology's impact on human purpose, and finally, the overlooked environmental consequences of our technological advancements, I navigate through philosophical critiques and real-world implications, shedding light on the complex dynamics shaping our technological landscape.
